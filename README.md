This game shows who is the king of the keyboard! If you're from HES-SO Valais-Wallis, -> send me your result <-

## Tutorial

To play the Fast and Precise GAME,

- Clone this repository in your IDE (IntelliJ is preferred).
- Open the `FastAndPrecise` Folder, not the ProjectV1.
- In `src` folder, double-click and launch the `Main.scala` file.

- In the game:
    1. Type the different letters to fill a word.
    2. For every word you have `18 seconds` before it falls down and stops the game.
    3. To go to the next round, you have to write every word shown on the screen.
    4. Every next round contains one more word to type on. 
    5. To replay the game, type `y`.
    6. To leave the game, type `q`.
    7. Enjoy and make the best score possible!
