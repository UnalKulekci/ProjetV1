## Tutorial

To play the Fast and Precise GAME,

1. Open the `Main.scala` file in your IDE (IntelliJ is preferred)
2. Type the different letters to fill a word.
3. For every word you have `18 seconds` before it falls down and stops the game.
4. Every next round contains one more word to type on.
5. To go to the next round, you have to write every word shown on the screen.
6. If you lose, you can always replay by clicking on `y`.
7. Enjoy and make the best score possible!
